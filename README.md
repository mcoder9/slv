## The Toolkit for Solana Devs

SLV is a toolkit for Solana developers. It provides a set of tools to help
developers build, test, and deploy Solana Validators and Solana-based
applications.

In the newly revamped slv, you can complete all configurations from a remote
machine—no more direct node logins required. This approach ensures that only
essential packages are installed on the node, leaving behind no unnecessary
clutter. We’ve also introduced Ansible Playbooks & Jinja Template for Linux
configuration, allowing us to manage and migrate multiple validators with
greater efficiency and security.

Additionally, the new slv always uses a dummy key (an invalid key named
“unstaked-identity.json”) for its initial startup. Once you confirm everything
is running smoothly, you simply set the actual Identity and switch to the active
key. Following this consistent flow helps prevent double votes and ensures
you’re prepared in case the node ever becomes unreachable.

We’ll continue to provide method documentation along the way, and we look
forward to your ongoing support!

```
This command will download the latest snapshot.

### New Features - Agave Testnet Validator Init & Deploy

Now you can deploy Solana Agave Testnet Validators with SLV.

```bash
slv v init
? Select Solana Network (testnet)
❯ testnet
  mainnet
? Select Validator Type (agave) › agave
> agave
  firedancer
```


### New Features - Firedancer Mainnet Validator Init & Deploy

? Select Validator Type (jito) › firedancer
  jito
> firedancer
```

### Introducing SLV Metal – Optimized Bare Metal for Solana Nodes ⚡️

SLV Metal is a high-performance bare metal server designed specifically for Solana nodes. 
Choosing the right server for Solana can be challenging, so we provide a curated list of fully optimized servers.

From hardware specs to network performance and Linux configuration, everything is fine-tuned for maximum efficiency. With SLV Metal, you can deploy Solana nodes in just a few commands.

```bash
slv metal list
? 🛡️ Select SLV BareMetal Type (validator)
❯ 🧪 For Solana Testnet Validator
  💰 For Solana Mainnet Validator
  ⚡️ RPC - For Solana RPC Node
  📦 APP - For Trade Bot, DApp and More!
```

## Deploy Solana Validator Testnet with Firedancer

You must have Ubuntu 24.04 LTS clean installed on your server.

This command will prompt you to provide necessary information to deploy.

New slv Deployment is always use `unstaked-keypair.json` for the identity key.
This is the best practice to avoid double voting, and etc.

So Please make sure to set the authorized identity key with `slv v set:identity`
after the deployment.


### Input Server's Default Username

Most of the time, the default username is `ubuntu`.

```bash
slv v init
? What's the user for the server? (ubuntu) › ubuntu
```

### Input Server's IP Address

Input the IP address of the server.

```bash
? What's the IP address of the server? ›
```

### Set RSA Key for SSH

※ Please set the path to your RSA key. The default path is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

```bash
? What's the path to your RSA key? (~/.ssh/id_rsa) › ~/.ssh/id_rsa
🔍 Checking SSH connection...
✔︎ SSH connection succeeded
```

Then slv will check the connection to the server. If the connection is
successful, the next step will be prompted.

### Set the solv user password

Please set the password for the `solv` user of the server.

**8 characters or more, including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters**

```bash
? Please enter your password › *********
? Please confirm your password › *********
✔︎ Password saved to ~/.slv/config.pwd.yml
```

Encrypted password will be saved to `~/.slv/config.pwd.yml`.

### Select the Solana Network

Select the Solana Network you want to deploy. ※ Currently, only the testnet is
supported.

```bash
? Select Solana Network (testnet)
❯ testnet
  mainnet
```

### Generate or Set the Solana Validator Identity

You can generate a new identity key or set an existing identity key. This
example shows how to set an existing identity key.

```bash
? Do you want to create a new identity key now? (Y/n) › No
? Please Enter Your Identity Public Key › EjDwu2Czy8eWEYRuNwtjniYks47Du3KNJ6JY9rs3aFSV
⚠️ Please place your identity key in 
        
  ~/.slv/keys/EjDwu2Czy8eWEYRuNwtjniYks47Du3KNJ6JY9rs3aFSV.json
.
.
✔︎ Success
✔ Inventory updated to ~/.slv/inventory.testnet.validators.yml
✔ Successfully created solv user on x.x.x.x
```

Please place your identity key in `~/.slv/keys/<your-pubkey>.json`. Then, slv
will create solv user with your password.

### Generate or Set the Solana Vote Account

You can generate a new vote account key or set an existing vote account key.
This example shows how to set an existing vote account key.

```bash
? Do you want to create a new vote account key now? (Y/n) › No
? Please Enter Your Vote Account Public Key > <your-vote-account>
```

### Set Your Authority Public Key

Please input your authority public key. This key is used to withdraw rewards
from the vote account.

```bash
? Please Enter Your Vote Account's Authority Key › <your-authority-pubkey>
✔︎ Validator testnet config saved to ~/.slv/inventory.testnet.validators.yml

Now you can deploy with:

$ slv v deploy -n testnet
```

Now your configuration is saved to `~/.slv/inventory.testnet.validators.yml`.

### Deploy the Solana Validator

Once you confirm the configuration, the deployment will start.

```bash
slv v deploy -n testnet -p EjDwu2Czy8eWEYRuNwtjniYks47Du3KNJ6JY9rs3aFSV
Your Testnet Validators Settings:
┌────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Identity Key   │ EjDwu2Czy8eWEYRuNwtjniYks47Du3KNJ6JY9rs3aFSV │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Vote Key       │ EwoVPLUhdhm722e7QWk8GMQ43917qRXiC9HFyefEMiSV │

│ Authority Key  │ EcT4NsMPwxanusdy3dza5nznqwuKo9Pz3GzW5GPD32SV │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ IP             │ x.x.x.x                                      │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Validator Type │ firedancer                                   │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Version        │ 0.406.20113                                  │
└────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
? Do you want to continue? (Y/n) › Yes
```

It's done! Your Solana Validator is now deployed. It will take some time to
catch up with the Solana network.

Next, You need to change the identity key from the unstaked key to the
authorized identity key.

### Change the Identity Key from Unstaked Key to Authorized Identity Key

After the deployment, you need to change the identity key from the unstaked key

to the authorized identity key.

```bash
slv v set:identity -n testnet --pubkey <your-identity-pubkey>
```

Then, the identity key will be changed to the authorized identity key. This
command will stop firedancer, change the identity key, and restart the
firedancer.

### Update slv

If you want to update the slv template, you can use the following command.

```bash
slv upgrade
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Add `slv validator init` for Solana Validator Deploy (in progress)
- [x] Add `slv rpc init` for Solana RPC Build (in progress)
- [x] Add CI/CD pipeline (Github Actions) for `slv` Release
- [] Add `slv bot` for gRPC Geyser Client (in progress)

## For Developers

Install Deno

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

Run slv CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValidatorsDAO/slv.git
deno task dev --help
```

Run Build

```bash
deno task build
```

Run Test

```bash
deno test -A
```

## Release Process

SLV uses GitHub Actions for automated releases. The process is as follows:

1. Update the version in `cmn/constants/version.ts`
2. Create and push a tag with the new version (e.g., `v0.6.1`)
3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run tests
   - Update all version references
   - Build the binaries
   - Upload artifacts to storage
   - Create a GitHub release

For heavy compilation tasks, SLV can use a remote build server:

1. Set up a Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server
2. Configure the server in `ansible/inventory.yml`
3. Use the remote build workflow:
   ```bash
   # Manually trigger the workflow
   gh workflow run slv-remote-build.yml -f version=0.6.1

   # Or push a tag
   git tag v0.6.1
   git push origin v0.6.1
   ```

See the `ansible/README.md` file for more details on remote builds. Improvements
are always welcome!
